Step-1  installing and necessary python libraries
Step-2  Loading the dataset to the colab notebook (21 classes, 100 images per class)
Step-3  Train-Test-val split 70-20-10 ratio
Step-4  Feature Extraction using SIFT module
Step-5  Model Training
	K-Means Clustering for all the descriptors
	Creating Histograms using those Descriptors
	Model Training (SVM)
	Model Training (KNN)
	Code Word Count (Bag of word count) - [10, 20, 50, 100]
Step-6 	Model Evaluation
	the train and test accuracies was plotted for all the 4 considered word count 
Observations - 
	KNN model works better when the word count is 20 showing around 56.5% accuracy 
	SVM model works better with word count 20 showing test accuracy of 56% as well.
	T-SNE reduction was done as well.
